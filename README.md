# BioSeq
A collection of computational biology tools written in Python for working with DNA/RNA seq data.

## Instructions
A BioSeq object can be instantiated by calling the BioSeq class with seq data, seq type, and a label. The utilities module provides functions which can read seq data from plain text or FASTA files, if required.

Once an object has been instantiated, the BioSeq class provides a variety of functions to analyse the given seq data. This includes transcription, translation, and calculating GC content.
